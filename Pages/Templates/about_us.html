            <h2 class="section-title">Coal Mining and Carbon Emissions</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Coal mining releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), making it a major contributor to global warming. Despite India's efforts to meet climate commitments, most coal mines lack precise tools to track their emissions accurately. This leads to underreported carbon footprints and ineffective management strategies.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>
                <p>Our platform provides a detailed, activity-wise carbon emission calculator that accounts for all major emission sources, not just methane. By using industry-specific emission factors, we ensure that coal mines receive accurate, transparent, and data-driven insights into their environmental impact.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lack of Real-Time Data and Visualization</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Most existing tools rely on spreadsheets and outdated manual calculations, making data tracking inefficient. Mine operators struggle with analyzing long-term emission trends, leading to poor decision-making.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>
                <p>We introduce interactive dashboards and real-time data visualization, replacing static spreadsheets with dynamic graphs and reports. This allows mines to monitor, compare, and analyze their carbon footprint effortlessly over time.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">One-Size-Fits-All Approach in Current Models</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Current emission tracking models treat all mines the same, ignoring key differences between underground and open-cast mines. This leads to inaccurate carbon footprint estimations and inefficient mitigation planning.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>
                <p>Our system allows customized input based on mine type, ensuring that both underground and open-cast mining operations get emission estimates tailored to their specific processes and challenges.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Static Emission Factors Lead to Inaccuracies</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Many tools rely on fixed IPCC emission factors, ignoring regional variations in coal composition, fuel efficiency, and mining techniques. This leads to inaccurate and generalized results that do not reflect real-world conditions.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>
                <p>Our platform uses dynamic, region-specific emission factors that consider coalfield variations, making emission estimates more precise and reflective of real mining conditions.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Regulatory Compliance and Reporting Challenges</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Many coal mines struggle to comply with evolving environmental regulations due to lack of proper emission tracking and standardized reporting systems. Inaccurate data can lead to penalties, delays in approvals, and missed sustainability targets.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Absence of Historical Emission Tracking</h2>
            <p class="argument">Argument: Without a centralized database to track past emissions, mines cannot analyze trends, compare performance, or assess the impact of operational changes. This limits their ability to make data-driven improvements.</p>
            <div class="our-help">
                <p class="our-help-title">Our Help:</p>
