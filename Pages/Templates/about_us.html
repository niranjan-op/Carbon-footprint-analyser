            <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i> The Environmental Impact of Coal Mining</h2>
            <p>Coal mining operations release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), both of which trap heat and accelerate global warming. As the second-largest coal producer globally, India depends heavily on coal for energy, but this comes with severe environmental consequences.</p>

                    <h3>Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h3>
                    <p>Coal mining emits CO₂ through diesel-powered equipment, blasting operations, fossil fuel-based electricity, and transportation. The energy sector, largely driven by coal, is responsible for nearly 40% of global CO₂ emissions.</p>

                    <h3>Methane Release</h3>
                    <p>Coal mining releases methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period. It comes from coal seams, ventilation systems, and abandoned mines that continue leaking methane long after operations cease.</p>

                    <h3>Deforestation</h3>
                    <p>Open-cast mining leads to massive deforestation, reducing Earth's ability to absorb CO₂ naturally. This results in biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and degradation, making land unsuitable for agriculture.</p>

                    <p>Existing models rely on generic emission factors that fail to account for regional variations in coal properties and mine-specific conditions.</p>

                    <h3>1. Coal Production Emissions</h3>
                    <p>We estimate CO₂ emissions by multiplying annual coal output with factors for energy content, exclusions, and CO₂ per energy unit.</p>
                </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Open-Cast Mines:</strong> We account for diesel used in overburden removal and carbon loss from land disturbance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Underground Mines:</strong> We calculate methane (CH₄) emissions, converted to CO₂ equivalents using global warming potential (GWP).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h3>3. Equipment & Fuel Emissions</h3>
                    <p>We include CO₂ from diesel machinery, explosives, and electricity, factoring in regional emission rates.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h3>4. Transportation Emissions</h3>
                    <p>We use transport mode-specific factors to calculate emissions from coal and waste transport distances.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h3>5. Waste Management</h3>
                    <p>We address emissions from refuse transport and disposal.</p>

                <div class="formula-title">Land disturbance:</div>
                <div class="formula">CO₂ = Area Disturbed (ha) × Carbon Stock Loss (tonnes CO₂/ha)</div>
                <p class="formula-explanation">When mining operations disturb land, stored carbon in soil and vegetation is released as CO₂. This formula calculates these emissions by multiplying the disturbed area by a region-specific carbon stock loss factor.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <div class="formula-title">Methane emissions:</div>
                <div class="formula">CO₂ = CH₄ released (m³) × Methane Emission Factor × (16.04 / 22.914) × 1000</div>
                <div class="formula-note">Where 16.04 is the molecular weight of methane and 22.914 is the molar volume at standard conditions</div>
                <p class="formula-explanation">Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with higher warming potential than CO₂. This formula converts methane volume to CO₂ equivalent by applying the molecular weight conversion and a methane-specific emission factor that accounts for its global warming potential.</p>
